# gale-shapley
An R implementation of the Gale-Shapley algorithm (a game theory algorithm by [Lloyd Shapley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lloyd_Shapley) and [Alvin Roth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvin_E._Roth) that finds a stable matching between n "schools" and m "students"). This means that the algorithm figures out which students should go to which schools such that no student and school that are not yet paired would be willing to let go of their current matches to be paired. It resolves several problems associated with alternative systems, and incentivizes students and schools to rank their true preferences. See [this AMS article](http://www.ams.org/publicoutreach/feature-column/fc-2015-03) for the story behind it (New York City public high school application system), and see the [Stable Marriage Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem) for more background information.

The Gale-Shapley algorithm has been used in public school districts as well as the medical school application system.
